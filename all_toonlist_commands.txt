[NOT WORKING YET] huntermeleeonfollow: (classic/wotlk/tbc only) In expansions where hunters have
a min range, they have two attack bars. Bar 1 is melee and bar 2 is ranged.
These bars switch automatically. Bar 2 (ranged) gets set every time you alt-4
(call your raid to follow). You can reverse this and set melee by default by using this command.
