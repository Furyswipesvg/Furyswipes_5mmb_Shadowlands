STOP: DO YOU WANT TO BE BANNED, SUCKA? IF SO, SKIP READING.
IF NOT, LISTEN CAREFULLY.
YOU MUST DELETE ALL FILES FROM HOTKEY NET, AUTOHOTKEY, AND ISBOXER, EVEN IF
YOU DON'T USE THEM. IF YOU DO NOT, YOU WILL BE BANNED IN LIVE WOW AND CLASSIC.
5mmb no longer uses hotkey net or sends any keys to windows (except
account/password)

HOW TO RUN 5-Minute Multiboxing:
BEFORE STARTING:
10 LANGUAGE SUPPORT: (classic) Your GSE macros may get translated, they may not. Check
when you start leveling. If they do get translated, you may have to remove
(rank x) from them to get them to work. Look at them ingame.

1) Unzip contents into your retail dir
2) Edit toonlist.txt  ... put in your info. See toonlist for instructions.
=======NOTE: ALT-CHARS okay IN TOON NAMES now! =============
3) Drag and drop the toonlist onto Read_Toonlist.bat
4) Leave the black console window OPEN. It switches your windows during
combat.
7) scroll lock on
8) ctrl-alt-m to login
9) When you are in, close all popups. 
10) /init in each window to initialize your buttons.
12) Notice that you now have buttons that match your spec, e.g. single_fs
     It contains /click FURY_SINGLE or some such. (we will pretend you are a
fury warrior)
     NOW (classic/retail) download a cool awesome st (single target) macro from
wowlazymacros.com. Name it FURY_SINGLE.
     Do the same for FURY_MULTI (multiple targets, possibly at range)
     FURY_AOE (multiple targets standing on you)
     FURY_TURBO (pop all your bursts--you'll have to make this one up)
                (My turbo button always contains a mount command on ctrl key)
     FURY_SETUP (anything you want to do periodically or before a fight)
11) Hit 0 key twice in your main window to invite/switch to free-for-all loot
(cancel raid warning dialog)
12) Interface Options--turn all action bars on.
13) alt-4 to make everyone SET their follow target. Tap 1 4-5 times to get
everyone to follow (or use EMA/EMAC)
14) 2 to attack a single target. (this will only work without additional setup
in classic) F repeatedly to make all toons attack/talk target. (not in tbc)
15) F1-F5 heals main window then next window clockwise 

Retail controls are similar to classic controls here:
