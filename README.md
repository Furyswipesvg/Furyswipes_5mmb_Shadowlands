#  What's. Up. Suckas.
#  This is 5-Minute Multiboxing


HEY! LISTEN! Download the latest release as a zip file over there on the releases link-->

5-minute-multiboxing is a set of files you can download into your wow directory that allows you to control up to 10 or more boxes at a time by helping you send a key one at a time to each box and changing the window that gets the next key automatically.

This does NOT clone keys or generate keys of any kind. (Exception: Fills in password, one window at a time).

This is a window swapping routine that runs while you play.

-----------------------------------------------------

BUT--5mmb is more than just window-swapping, AS IF!
5mmb also contains an addon, Furyswipes_5mmb that does amazing things for you in game to get you multiboxing in 5 minutes!

First, it gives you a new cmomand in wow:
/init
Be careful--this will mess up all your bars and bindings. But this is the key to getting started fast--everytoon has the same bindings. Press a 2 on one toon (attack single target), then press 2 again and the next window attacks single target. Press 2 5 times fast. Then do it one million more times. Loot boss. Get girls with your fancy new gear.

The addon gives you the zero key "0" to party up when you are finished initting.

The addon also gives you another super-power:
alt-4  (no, not alt-F4, that's a different superpower [Try it!]) Alt-4 when you are in party makes all your party members follow. You only have to click it once.

All you need to know to kill a boss is this:

/init for everyone
0 to party
alt-4 to follow
2 to smash

Now, you are only going to smash if you are currently a certain subset of specs. If not, you need to make your own GSE macros for your spec. It's easy, and you can copy ready made versions from wowlazymacros.com

Theres some other stuff to know.
