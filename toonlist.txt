#THIS IS YOUR TOONLIST. READ THESE COMMENTS BEFORE ASKING
# A QUESTION ON DISCORD. EVERY ONE.
# Lines that start with # are comments, and have no effect. You can delete.
# Use a technical editor for this, NOT notepad. Notepad runs lines together.
# Try notepad++

# OPTIONAL: Set this rectangle to your clique overlay area. 
# I suggest the right half of the main window's raid interface
# It is currently set to not be there. See #user-guides on discord. There
# is a video.

# You can use 2 monitors by uncommenting the following
#use2monitors

# each window you open is defined by a box command.
# Max number of box lines is 5 (for now).
# The box command starts with the word box.
# Then battlenet account.
# Then password.
# Then subscription name (not important, can be anything, just a reminder)
# Then toon name (with additional server name after dash on retail).
# Then role tank / melee / healer / caster / hunter
# You may add letters at the end 
# to launch certain boxes when you hit ctrl-alt-<letter>
# The letters are like their raid identifier. Example--The f
# at the end of furyswipes line means ctrl-alt-f only opens him
# Each toon can be in many different raids. 
# ALL BOXES ARE IN RAID m by default. This cannot be changed!
# ctrl alt m launches all your guys in this toonlist.
# Alt characters are okay, chinese is not.
# NOTE--For retail, if you play on different servers, you should 
# put -<server> after your toon name. Otherwise invites won't work.
# You do NOT need to do this for wotlk/classic/tbc! Caps don't matter,
# spelling do.
# IF YOU HAVE SPACES IN YOUR PASSWORD OR SERVERNAME YOU MUST USE QUOTES
# See example
box bnetaccount bnetpassword wow1 Furyswipes-cenarius tank f
box bnetaccount bnetpassword wow2 "mootalia-altar of storms" melee
box bnetaccount bnetpassword wow3 spirited-nathrezim healer
box bnetaccount bnetpassword wow4 vajayjay-nathrezim caster
box bnetaccount bnetpassword wow5 battlefield-nathrezim caster

# extrawait1 and extrawait2 are new keywords that allow you to control the
# timing of window opening if you find that windows aren't getting populated
# with passwords and accounts properly or that the windows are strangely logging
# into the wrong account. Start with the numbers shown. They are milliseconds,
# and you can tune them for whatever works.
# extrawait1 is a pause between opening wow and renaming the window.
# extrawait2 is a pause after the window is renamed but before trying to
# insert password/account
extrawait1 300
extrawait2 1000

# meleeiwt (melee interact with target) makes your melee roles run toward 
# the target or turn toward the target every swing.
# sendwwithiwt makes them take a small step forward when the do to prevent
# running wildly around the target during combat.

# huntermeleeonfollow (classic/wotlk/tbc only) 
# In expansions where hunters have a min range, they have two attack bars.
# Bar 1 is melee and bar 2 is ranged. These bars switch automatically.
# Bar 2 (ranged) gets set every time you alt-4 (call your raid to follow)
# You can reverse this and set melee by default by using this command.

# raidname Assign your raid a catchy internal name so when you are combining
# with another multiboxer, you don't conflict

# oemkey This is an override that should only be used in rare cases.
# It assigns the oemkey used to share mouse clicks. To figure out what yours
# is, turn on the "Last Key Pressed" panel in HKN, and click the key left of
# 1. It will tell you the name of that key, oem3,oem5,oem7,oem8
# Normally you do not have to do this, but if your keyboard is not found 
# (see WARNING when you drag-n-drop), you will.
#oemkey oem3 (again, do not use this unless absolutely necessary)

# maxheal <druid> <priest> <shaman> <paladin>
# This is not currently implemented this release, but it is supposed to limit
# your heal rank on a given class to a number, example:
# maxheal 5 7 3 4
# In this example, Shaman will cast no more than healing wave 3.
#maxheal 11 11 11 11
